# LoL-Winner-Predictor
This project is a machine learning-based winner predictor for League of Legends (LoL) matches. The predictor takes in pre-game statistics and outputs the probability of each team winning. The main objective is to provide insights into how certain features impact the likelihood of victory in a competitive match.

Credit must be given to the following Kaggle dataset from which I extracted the data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/league-of-legends
